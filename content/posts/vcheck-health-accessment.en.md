In this opportunity I come to show you how to download and use the `vCheck` tool that is used to validate the health status of the `VMware vSphere` infrastructure. This tool is developed by [Alan Renouf](http://www.virtu-al.net) as a mechanism to identify possible failures or misconfiguration in the `vSphere` implementation. To learn more about this tool I will use the `vCheck` documentation as a reference:

> This script picks on the key known issues and potential issues scripted as plugins for various technologies written as Powershell scripts and reports it all in one place so all you do in the morning is checking your email.

In this area I present to you what is checked when using `vCheck`.

- General Details
- Number of Hosts
- Number of VMs
- Number of Templates
- Number of Clusters
- Number of Datastores
- Number of Active VMs
- Number of Inactive VMs
- Number of DRS Migrations for the last days
- Snapshots over x Days old
- Datastores with less than x% free space
- VMs created over the last x days
- VMs removed over the last x days
- VMs with No Tools
- VMs with CD-Roms connected
- VMs with Floppy Drives Connected
- VMs with CPU ready over x%
- VMs with over x amount of vCPUs
- List of DRS Migrations
- Hosts in Maintenance Mode
- Hosts in disconnected state
- NTP Server check for a given NTP Name
- NTP Service check
- vmkernel warning messages ov the last x days
- VC Error Events over the last x days
- VC Windows Event Log Errors for the last x days with VMware in the details
- VC VMware Service details
- VMs stored on datastores attached to only one host
- VM active alerts
- Cluster Active Alerts
- If HA Cluster is set to use host datastore for swapfile, check the host has a swapfile location set
- Host active Alerts
- Dead SCSI Luns
- VMs with over x amount of vCPUs
- vSphere check: Slot Sizes
- vSphere check: Outdated VM Hardware (Less than V7)
- VMs in Inconsistent folders (the name of the folder is not the same as the name)
- VMs with high CPU usage
- Guest disk size check
- Host over committing memory check
- VM Swap and Ballooning
- ESXi hosts without Lockdown enabled
- ESXi hosts with unsupported mode enabled
- General Capacity information based on CPU/MEM usage of the VMs
- vSwitch free ports
- Disk over commit check
- Host configuration issues
- VCB Garbage (left snapshots)
- HA VM restarts and resets
- Inaccessible VMs

It is important to mention that `vCheck` has support for other products as shown in the following image:

To get started you need to download the tool from the [GitHub](https://github.com/alanrenouf/vCheck-vSphere) portal where it is continuously developed. To download `vCheck` directly click on the following link [Download](https://github.com/alanrenouf/vCheck-vSphere)

Once the script is downloaded, it is necessary to unzip it.

The first time `vCheck` is run it will start the configuration process, this configuration allows you to create a template with the information that will be used for all future runs of the program. To modify these parameters again you can use the `-config` option as follows:

```powershell
[blabla@blabla ~]$ pwsh #Powershell core on Linux :)
PowerShell 7.1.3
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

PS /home/blabla/vCheck> ./vCheck.ps1 -config
```

In this area I demonstrate the `vCheck` configuration process.

After setting up the initial configuration we can start running the main script of the tool using the `vCheck.ps1 -Outputpath` command. The `Outputpath` option allows us to set where the report will be saved. When you run the command it will ask you for the vCenter login credentials. In my case I used the default administrator account, but it is recommended to use an account with read-only privileges.

```powershell
PS /home/blabla/vCheck> ./vCheck.ps1 -Outputpath vcheck-reports/                                   

Specify Credential
Please specify server credential
User: administrator@vsphere.local #vCenter credentials
Password for user administrator@vsphere.local: ````
```

In this area I show you the example of the `vCheck` collection process.

Once the command finishes, an `.html` file will be created with the result of the report. `vCheck` has the feature of being able to schedule the report to be sent by e-mail on a recurring basis. So, you can have a weekly report of how is the health of your virtual infrastructure.

Here are several examples of report generated with `vCheck`.
