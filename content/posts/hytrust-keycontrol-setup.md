`HyTrust KeyControl` Enabled encryption users to easily manage their encryption keys at scale. `HyTrust` is the only KMS vendor that VMware invested in. It is available as an OVA, for fast installation and configuration in VMware vCenter. In this post I show you how to easily install and configure this KMS service in a `vSphere` environment.

##### Step 1 – Deploying the OVA Package

##### Step 2 – Configuring the newly deployed KMS appliance

Power on the newly deployed VM server. It will ask you to specify a password for the `htadmin` account. Enter a new password for `htadmin` and press `OK`.

Download and save the Admin Key to a secure location.

#### Note: This key is primarily used for recovery purpose

##### Step 3 – Enable the KMIP Service

![Text](/img/2021-03-13_16-39_1-1024x379.webp#center)

The `Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)` enables communication between key management systems and cryptographically-enabled applications, including email, databases, and storage devices. Select `KMIP` in the top banner bar. Go to State and put it on `Enabled`. Then open Protocol and select `Version 1.1` from the drop-down list. As a final step go to `Restrict TLS` and select `Enabled` to make sure traffic is on the TLS 1.2 protocol. Click the `Apply` button now to apply the new settings.

### Summary

We have now added and configure the KMS server which gives us some extra security possibilities for our infrastructure or cryptographically-enabled applications.
