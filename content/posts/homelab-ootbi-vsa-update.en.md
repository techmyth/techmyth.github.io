Hola a tod@s

In this opportunity, I would like to show you how to update the version of the `Object First OOTBI` VSA appliance. I previously demonstrated how to perform the initial implementation of this product. You can find the article here. [aquí]({{< ref "homelab-ootbi-vsa-initial-setup.es.md" >}} "aquí")

Starting with the vCenter portal, find the virtual machine instance so that you can access the `OOTBI` text user interface.

After that, we proceed with the following steps:

#### Step 1: Access the OOTBI console (TUI)

In this step you'll access the `OOTBI` management console where you're going to select the `Software Updates` from the text menu.

#### Step 2: Accept update changes

If the wizard finds a new version, it will notify you to accept the changes by pressing the `Enter` option.
