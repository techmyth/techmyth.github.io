Hello from the Caribbean ðŸ¥¥ðŸŒ´ðŸŒºðŸŒ…ðŸŒŠ,

Since stepping away from the `Veeam Vanguard` program, Iâ€™ve been somewhat distant from the development of the [AsBuiltReport.Veeam.VBR](https://github.com/AsBuiltReport/AsBuiltReport.Veeam.VBR) report. However, last month I dedicated time to enhancing the [Veeam.Diagrammer](https://github.com/rebelinux/Veeam.Diagrammer) module, adding new features to generate diagrams of Cloud Connect infrastructure and the resources used by `Tenants` in `Veeam Backup & Replication`.

Thanks to these improvements in Veeam.Diagrammer, itâ€™s now possible to generate detailed diagrams of the Cloud Connect infrastructure and its components. The following image showcases the elements configured within `Veeam Backup & Replication`.

Another key feature in this release is the ability to generate tenant-specific diagrams, providing a clear visualization of the resources used within the infrastructure. With `Veeam.Diagrammer`, you can now extract detailed information about replica resources (vSphere, VCloud Director, and Hyper-V), backup resources, SubTenants, WAN Accelerators, and network devices. This makes it much easier to analyze and manage each tenantâ€™s environment.

#### Examples of Tenant Diagrams

> **Note:** To generate tenant-specific diagrams, set the Tenant [InfoLevel](https://github.com/AsBuiltReport/AsBuiltReport.Veeam.VBR?tab=readme-ov-file#infolevel) option to `2`.

Below is the main diagram of the `Veeam` infrastructure, now updated to include the new Cloud Connect components. This provides a more comprehensive and detailed view of the environment.
