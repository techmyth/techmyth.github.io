Hello,

In the latest version of `Veeam.Diagrammer` I added the ability to diagram the `Veeam Backup & Replication` infrastructure. Here is the link to the tool:

- <https://github.com/rebelinux/Veeam.Diagrammer>

Previously, this diagram could only be accessed through the [AsbuiltReport.Veeam.VBR](https://github.com/AsBuiltReport/AsBuiltReport.Veeam.VBR) report. Now in version `v0.6.4` you can generate this infrastructure diagram with `Veeam.Diagrammer` directly.

Here is an example of the diagram:

In the following video I attempt to show you how to install and use this tool:

#### Side note: My video editing skills are a disaster. :)
