In this opportunity I come to show you how to get free Veeam licenses that you can use to protect your `HomeLab` or can be used to practice if you are planning to get certified as a `Veeam Certified Engineer (VMCE)`. I am currently protecting my virtual environment with these licenses that can be obtained if you meet one of these requirements:

Although there is a `Veeam Community` version that is also freely available, this license does not have all the features of the NFR edition. I have included the link of the Veeam portal where you can compare the features available for each type of edition. Here is the link:
